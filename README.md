# TML25 Assignment 1 â€“ Membership Inference Attack

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains our solution to Assignment 1 of the **Trustworthy Machine Learning** course (SS 2025), focused on implementing a **Membership Inference Attack (MIA)** on a ResNet-18 model. Our goal was to infer the membership status of data points in a private dataset by generating continuous confidence scores using various model-based and statistical features.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

We extract both **engineered features** (confidence, entropy, RMIA score, etc.) and **deep features** from the penultimate layer of ResNet-18. We also compute **cosine similarity** to member and non-member mean embeddings. PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality. These features are combined and used to train an **XGBoost** classifier on the public dataset. The classifier is then applied to the private dataset to generate membership scores.
